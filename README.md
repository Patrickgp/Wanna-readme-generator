  # Description
  This program will allow users to answer prompts on their local machine's terminal and dynamically generate a professional README for their repository. Using Node.js, Inquirer, and FS we are able to take terminal prompts and return the user's input to stored variables. We then create a README.md file and write the variables into the document.
